<p id="head">Each meeting, we try to travel to a new location within Michigan. During the winter months we schedule a trip to a southern region, as our classes take a break and the birds fly south. Enjoy, and direct any questions or feedback to our <a href="Contact.html">Contact Us</a> page!</p>

	<h3>March 2018</h3>
	  	<p class="cap">Back in Michigan, but spring has not yet sprung in full. Instead, many trees are still bare and the birds are scarce. I couldn't find a single noteworthy shot this month. Luckily, one of our BirdSpotter students shot these perching birds a few days ago. They look about as confused about the weather as I feel.

<h3>Feb 2018</h3>
	<p class="cap">Ah, the Turaco. Literally translated "banana-eater", largely thought of as a "go-away" bird for the populus of South Africa. As their name suggests, turacos enjoy bananas and can become so tame as to be hand-fed. This close-up encapsulates the beauty of the eye detail- those bright orange ridges inside the pale green.

<p class="cap">The beauty of Europe! We took a little detour this month to sight-see, but didn't forget to stop for the birds. Although it's hard to see in the jumble, here's a list of all the bird species in this picture. See if you can spot them out!

<h3>Dec 2018</h3>
	<p class="cap">We have arrived! Touching down in the middle of the continent of Africa, we plan to make the entire circuit in just a few months. No sleigh bells to be found in these jungles.. Although this picture still gives me a sense of holiday spirit. Is it the green and red of the rose-ringed parakeet? Or those juicy berries in its maw, which has the distinct look of holly typically strung by the fireplace?</p>
	
	<p class="cap">It's been looking less and less like Christmas, but these parakeets are so social it feels like santa's present to the BirdSpotters. This little guy didn't even flinch when the camera came up close. It was as though he were inviting us to watch him enjoy his meal(and it is a "he"- as shown by the colors).
